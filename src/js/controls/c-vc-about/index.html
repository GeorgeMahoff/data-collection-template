            The project addresses the development of a web based crowdsourcing platform for image annotations using
            a Rich Internet Application architecture, whereby the interface is contained in a single page and
            client-server roundtrips are minimized.
        </p>
        <p>
            The application manages crowdsourcing campaigns published by <b>managers</b> and executed by <b>workers</b>.
            Both kinds of users can register in the platform and login under their specific role.
        </p>
        <p>
            The manager can create one or more crowdsourcing campaigns. A campaign has a name, some configuration
            parameters and a set of input images. Aim of the campaign is the annotation of images with the skyline
            of the landscape. A preliminary step allows workers to validate or discard the images to be annotated:
            only the images that contain a mountain profile will pass this first stage and therefore are <i>selected</i>;
            they will be then <i>annotated</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Each task is executed by a set of workers; the assignment of the images to each worker is decided by
            means of a scheduling algorithm, which is based on parameters associated with the campaign (the algorithm
            needs not be realized and will be provided through APIs). The workerâ€™s tasks are executed as follows:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Image Selection task</b>: the input for this task is an image; its output is a Boolean value specifying
                if the image contains a mountain profile or not. Given the image, the user can only accept or reject it.
                For a given image the task must be executed by at least N workers: the value of N is a campaign
                specific configuration parameter defined by the manager. If an image obtains at least K positive
                evaluations in the Image Selection task, it can be annotated. K is a campaign specific configuration
                parameter defined by the manager.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Image Annotation task</b>: the input of this task is an image; its output is a line (or a set of
                lines, if the skyline is interrupted by obstacles), which identifies the profile (skyline) of
                the mountain. Given the image the user can: <b>draw</b> the line (the component for drawing the line
                will be provided); <b>clear</b> the annotation, i.e., erase the current annotation and restart drawing;
                <b>send</b> the annotation to the server. It is not permitted to send an empty annotation to the server.
                The width of the annotation line is a campaign configuration parameter (an integer number of pixels,
                between 1 to 10). For each image of the campaign, this task must be executed by at least M workers:
                M is a campaign specific configuration parameter defined by the manager.
            </li>
        </ul>
